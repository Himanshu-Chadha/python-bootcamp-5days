# Day 3 – NumPy Basics

This folder contains my learnings and assignments from **Day 3 of the Python Bootcamp**.  
The focus of this day was on **NumPy basics** – array creation, properties, arithmetic operations, statistical functions, and small applications.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Taking user input and creating NumPy arrays
- Array properties: `size`, `shape`, `ndim`, `dtype`
- Converting arrays between data types
- Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**2`, `np.add()`, `np.subtract()`, `np.multiply()`, `np.divide()`
- If-else with arrays (`np.mean()`, `np.max()`, `np.min()`)
- Statistical functions: `mean`, `median`, `std`, `var`, `min`, `max`
- Small problem-solving applications using NumPy
