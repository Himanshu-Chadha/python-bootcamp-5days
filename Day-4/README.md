# 📅 Day 4 – Pandas Basics

## 📖 Overview
- Today was focused on **Pandas Basics** in Python.  
- Learned the fundamentals of working with **DataFrames**:
  - Creating DataFrames using `pd.DataFrame()`
  - Inspecting structure with `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, `columns`, `dtypes`, `info()`
  - Handling missing values (`dropna()`, `fillna()`)
  - Summarizing data with `describe()`, `agg()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`
  - Grouping and category-wise analysis using `groupby()`  

## 📝 Assignment
- The Day 4 assignment tested understanding of:
  - Fill in the blanks (basic pandas concepts)
  - Match the columns (functions vs. their descriptions)
  - True/False questions
  - Short theory answers
  - Two practical coding tasks:
    1. **Weekly Milk Sales Data** – creating a DataFrame, previewing data, checking structure  
    2. **Monthly Expenses Summary** – creating a DataFrame and calculating total, average, max, min

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Pandas provides powerful tools to explore and analyze tabular data.  
- Learned how to quickly inspect datasets and perform essential aggregations.  
- Grouping + aggregation are very useful for **category-wise summaries**.  
- Day 4 built a strong foundation for **data analysis with pandas**, which is crucial for real-world datasets.
