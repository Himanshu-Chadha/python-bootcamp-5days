# 🐍 Python Bootcamp – 5 Days

This repository contains all my learnings, notes, and assignments from the **5-Day Python Bootcamp** conducted by CODING WISE.

The bootcamp is designed for beginners to build a strong foundation in Python, covering basic syntax, data types, control flow, functions, and more.  
Here I will maintain **daily assignments, solutions, and key takeaways**.

### ✅ Day 3 – NumPy Basics
- Introduction to NumPy and why it is useful
- Creating arrays with `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`
- Understanding array properties: `.size`, `.shape`, `.ndim`, `.dtype`
- Type conversion with `.astype()`
- Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring
- Statistical functions: `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, `np.std()`, `np.var()`, `np.min()`, `np.max()`
- If-else operations with arrays (average, max, min checks)
- Small real-world style applications (grades, salaries, ages, even numbers, etc.)
- [Day-3 Folder](Day-3)

### ✅ Day 4 – Pandas Basics
- Introduction to **Pandas** and DataFrames
- Creating and inspecting DataFrames using:
  - `pd.DataFrame()`, `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, `columns`, `dtypes`, `info()`
- Handling missing values:
  - `dropna()`, `fillna()`
- Summarizing data:
  - `describe()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`, `agg()`
- Grouping and aggregation with `groupby()` and `.agg()`
- Assignment included:
  - Conceptual questions (fill in the blanks, match the columns, true/false, theory)
  - Practical coding tasks:
    1. Weekly Milk Sales Data (creating DataFrame, preview, structure)  
    2. Monthly Expenses Summary (calculating total, average, max, min)
- [Day-4 Folder](Day-4)

### ✅ Day 5 – Coding Contest
- Final evaluation of the bootcamp (50 Marks, 1 Hour)  
- Covered:
  - Match the Columns, True/False, Fill in the Blanks
  - Theory questions (DataFrames, if/elif, NumPy aggregates, type conversion, etc.)
  - Coding Questions:
    1. NumPy Array Statistics (mean, max, min)  
    2. Even/Odd Checker  
    3. Pandas DataFrame (Products & Prices, average price)  
    4. NumPy Count Elements > 4  
    5. Positive/Negative/Zero Checker  
- [Day-5 Folder](Day-5)
